## Welcome to the JBoxes project

### Goal

The main goal of the jBoxes software is to provide learners with a semantic model for a Java-like languageâ€”a detailed, concrete conceptual picture of how the computer behaves when it performs the instructions given to it in a program.

#### Acknowledgements

jBoxes is the brainchild of Dr. Gerald Shultz, Professor Emeritus at Metropolitan State University of Denver.
